# Render Experiments

A project, I made to play around with shaders and visual effects. It is entirely written in C++ and uses DirectX 12 to draw stuff on the screen.

First and only thing so far, that I tried rendering, are some real-time procedurally generated clouds, inspired by [this article](https://advances.realtimerendering.com/s2015/The%20Real-time%20Volumetric%20Cloudscapes%20of%20Horizon%20-%20Zero%20Dawn%20-%20ARTR.pdf).

One can compile the project, using Visual Studio 2022 and CMake 3.8.
